      <p>
        I'm a software developer working in bioinformatics and public health infrastructure
        with a passion for building things that matter. Professionally, I architect microservices
        that process thousands of lab results for epidemiological analysis across multiple health agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I contribute to open-source projects in the .NET and Blazor ecosystem
        and love building my own tools and libraries, from messaging systems to tokenizers to
        reactive frameworks. You can check them all out on my <a href="https://github.com/andres-m-rodriguez" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.
        I've also been featured in a <a href="/speaking">Microsoft Student Zone session</a> where I presented
        a scalable AI-powered course platform, and I'm currently building a federally funded
        conservation mapping tool for US wildlife agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always looking forward to the next challenge and learning something new :)
